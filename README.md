<h2><b>So what is the point of such a system?</b><h2>
<p>Let's go deeper. There are three parties involved in this market. Users, platform providers and content creators. The <b><u>users dictate</b></u> the terms. Where they go the others follow.
</p>
<br>
  <h2><b>Centralized System<b></h2>
<p>
There is a monopoly in the market for content control, control over what a user views, direct actions can be taken by monopolies to fire a content creator without even noticing him/her, Not much transparency in data, Can Increase fare anytime.
</p>
 <h2><b>DeCentralized System<b></h2>  
   <p>Similar platforms Dtube, Brave, SteemIt.</p>
<br>
<p>
We are building a DApp which will enable viewers and content creators to interact directly without any 3rd Party getting in and controlling a viewers view or creators content.</p>
<p>
  We provide users a platform to upload their contents and view other user's content.</p>
<p>We provide appreciation method that is a user can donate content creators for their content.
<p>The Users have rights to view a Ad or block it.
<p>The AdAgency can place their Ads on monthly/yearly basis to the platform.
<p>The content creator will be appreciated with tokens once a certain number of users like his/her content.
<p>The Users get benefitted for watching the Ads.</p>
