### So what is the point of such a system?

<p>Let's go deeper. There are three parties involved in this market. Users, platform providers and content creators. The <b><u>users dictate</b></u> the terms. Where they go the others follow.

<br>
  <h2>Centralized System</h2>

There is a monopoly in the market for content control, control over what a user views, direct actions can be taken by monopolies to fire a content creator without even noticing him/her, Not much transparency in data, Can Increase fare anytime.

### Features
